# TODO

- [ ] Troubleshoot why on earth if typing in BT-mode 1 (not paired to any devise, so should just go to /dev/null), and then switching to BT-mode 0 (paired to laptop) somehow sens all key presses from BT-mode 1 to laptop
- [ ] add FN keys
- [ ] check my CTRL+hjkl I use in insert mode with my new keymap+layers.
- [ ] check NUMBER+jk for quick navigation.
- [ ] Fix not being able to move across words with alt+arrows:
  - Layer1 + Alt Homerow + arrow doesn't work. 
  - only Alt Homerow + Layer 1 + arrow does.

# Inspo:

- [urob's zmk config](https://github.com/urob/zmk-config#timeless-homerow-mods)
  - it has some combos and leader+keys for unicode chars.
  - [ ] from here, take the `.conf` files as well.
